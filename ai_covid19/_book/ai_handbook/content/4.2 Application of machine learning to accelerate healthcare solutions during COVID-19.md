Scientist can now apply machine learning to accelerate the process of finding medicine for COVID-19. For example, Oxford-based Exscientia is now using machine learning techniques to accelerate the process of finding effective medicine. Specifically, AI can learn the structure of DNA and the virus efficiently. It can then quickly analyze big data related to medicine information in order to identify those medicines which have the potential of treating COVID-19.
