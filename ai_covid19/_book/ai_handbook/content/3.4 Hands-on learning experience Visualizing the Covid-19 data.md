notebooks# 3.4 Hands-on learning experience: Visualizing the Covid-19 data ![11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-11%2B-blueviolet)

Due to the characteristics of Python, many Internet masters have developed library functions to support various types of applications. In practicing machine learning algorithms, most of the data sources are available via the web, and this time the epidemic data is the same. Thus, the process of reading data by Python can be demonstrated simply as follows,

```python
# pd.read_csv is the function to save the csv format file from web url.
pd.read_csv('https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/blob/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv ', parse_dates=['Date'])
countries = ['Canada', 'Germany', 'United Kingdom', 'US', 'France', 'China']
```

where pd is the provided library, and the command function is read.csv (URL), i.e., go directly to the URL to capture the web archive (a comma-separated text file), the field name is date, and the countries classified are Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, France and China.

```python
# The definition of graphic colors and styles to present country data in different colors
colors = {'Canada':'#045275', 'China':'#089099', 'France':'#7CCBA2', 'Germany':'#FCDE9C', 'US':'#DC3977', 'United Kingdom':'#7C1D6F'}
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
# Create Visual Appearance, including graphic size, arrangement
plot = covid.plot(figsize=(12,8), color=list(colors.values()), linewidth=5, legend=False)
```

According to the description on web page, the Python library provided by the other party can only takes 5 minutes of program training, and the results are shown in Figure 7. The whole process is easy and clearly. Lines of codes are less than 20, less than three lines of codes are used for the data operation, and the rests are handling on the picture design.
