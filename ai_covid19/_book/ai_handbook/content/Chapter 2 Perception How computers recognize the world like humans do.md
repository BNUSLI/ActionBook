# Chapter 2 Perception: How computers recognize the world like humans do? ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen)

Perception is one of the most important abilities for human and some animals. It is the ability to help animals (humans included) be aware of physical environments. It has been primarily associated biological species. Different animals are equipped with different perception abilities. Human perception is the ability to see, hear, or become aware of your surroundings through the senses. As shown in Figure 4, while the human body perceives the world with its five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste and touch), computers mimic, or copy, human intelligence and use different sensors (cameras, sound detectors, etc.), similar to the human senses, to perceive the world. Making computers “see” and “hear” like humans is one of the important AI achievements.
