"When will school reopen? What is the evolution of COVID-19? How long will COVID -19 last?  How can we know the trend of this pandemic?‚Äù Many people are now asking these questions. To answer all these questions and predict how the virus will spread, Tuli et al. (2020) built a machine learning model to make a good advanced prediction of the number of new cases and the dates when the pandemic might end. For example, the model shown in Figure 22 shows curves corresponding to both new cases and deaths across the world.
