# Chapter 5 Natural interaction: Can computers understand humans and talk to them? ![11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-11%2B-blueviolet)

AI is now used to make machines intelligent and interact and communicate like humans. For example, we can mention the case of Siri which is a smart virtual assistant developed by Apple Inc (see several examples in Figure 27). It uses voice queries and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of internet services.

To conduct natural language interaction and communicate with humans, a machine conducts the following steps: **(1)** take the human input, such as speech; **(2)** analyze the input (speech) to understand what a person is trying to say; **(3)** do the reasoning process to provide an accurate answer or perform a task; and, **(4)** perform the action, by answering the user back or executing a specific task. To deliver an intelligent, humanlike experience, a machine should use a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) principles and technologies. For instance, Figure 28 shows a communication scenario between a human and a virtual assistant to play a specific music.

NLP is defined as the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech. In other words: the use of different techniques from computer science (algorithms) to understand and manipulate human language and speech. NLP has the following two main components:

- Natural Language Understanding (NLU): It revolves around machine reading comprehension. This is an AI-hard problem. An NLU system needs the following components: **(1)** Lexicon, Parser, and Grammar rules; and, **(2)** Semantic theory to guide comprehension.

- Natural Language Generation (NLG) is concerned with generating natural language. It uses a machine representation system like a knowledge base or a logical form. You can think of it as a translator between data and natural language representation; this is the opposite of NLU. This involves three tasks: **(1)** Text Planning- To extract relevant content from the knowledge base; **(2)** Sentence Planning- To choose appropriate words, form meaningful phrases, and set sentence tone; and, **(3)** Text Realization- To map the sentence plan into sentence structure.
