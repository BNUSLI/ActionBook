one of the emerging technologies that has been frequently used in our daily life in different domains, including, education, medicine, finance, etc. However, even though AI is frequently used and mentioned in the media, there is still lack of AI understanding. Technological literacy is also very important now, because children are growing up in smart environments where they interact with intelligent devices, like robots and tablets. As children gain exposure and understanding of AI technology, their reasoning about these devices becomes more thoughtful and nuanced. Currently, educators lack information on how to teach teenagers AI, but there is a tremendous need for this to happen rapidly given this pandemic.\nSeveral AI solutions (e.g., using robotics, face recognition, etc.) have been developed to combat several crises, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore important to prepare the young generation for the next crisis/pandemic in the era of AI. The more knowledgeable the upcoming generation is of AI technologies, the more likely they are to develop smart solutions that will serve for the well-being of humans in crisis and maintain several vital activities, including economical, educational and health activities.\nBased on the above background, this book introduces AI to children, between the age of 9 and 15, in an easy and fun way. It also presents vivid stories about some AI-based solutions that were developed to combat the pandemic. Furthermore, this book presents hands-on learning experience about AI by showing simple programming code that children could use and implement on the JupyterLab environment. JupyterLab is an open-source web-based interactive development environment that can support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. The book is structured according to the Five Big Ideas in AI developed by Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) for K-12 students, namely perception, representation and reasoning, learning, natural interaction and societal impact. The interactive AI-based version of this book, where readers can interact with the presented content and code (test, modify and download it), can be found on the Jupyter environment: http://yuanzhuo.bnu.edu.cn/article/653\nIt should be noted that this book can also be read by other people with different ages who may not have any background about AI. Parents and teachers can also use this book to introduce AI to their children or students respectively, and guide them to interact with the presented code online.\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/Acknowledgement.html":{"url":"content/Acknowledgement.html","title":"Acknowledgement","keywords":"","body":"Acknowledgement\nMany people have helped us in finalizing this book.

It is much bigger than that; It has been a research area in computer science and engineering. Now, it is part of our life. There are many different types of AI. AI is about making machines, such as computers, be smart and mimic human behaviors.\n\n\n\n\nArtificial (/ˌɑr təˈfɪʃ əl/)\n\n\n\n\nSomething made or produced by people, often as a copy of something natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence (/ɪnˈtɛl ɪ dʒəns/)\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to learn, think, understand, and make decisions that are based on reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 1. AI representation in movies\n\n\nIn fact, we are interacting and communicating with 'machines' all the time, they are like one of us. The field of AI that made this possible is called speech recognition. AI-enabled computers (we also call them machines, or in some countries, we simply call them electronic brain) can now read and write text like humans, and the type of AI that allows this to happen is called Natural Language Processing (NLP). In addition to the ability of language processing, scientists have made computers do other things that are uniquely to human, we call 'higher order cognitive abilities' such as thinking, reasoning, and decision making. It has been shown that these abilities of human brain are largely due to its special interaction style between neurons (the basic elements of human brain). Scientists enable computers with these higher-order cognitive capability by implementing something called 'brain-style computation' between neural networks. To implement these presented examples, AI relies on analyzing data using several algorithms to achieve its objective. Figure 2 presents examples of how AI technologies could mimic human actions and behaviors.\n\n\n\nNetwork (/ˈnɛtˌwɜrk/)\n\n\n\n\nA large system consisting of many similar parts, such as lines, tubes, nerves, etc. that are connected to each other and operate together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData (/ˈdeɪtə, ˈdætə, ˈdɑtə/)\n\n\n\n\nInformation, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and used to discover things or to make decisions.

Examples of how AI technologies could mimic human actions\n\n\nAI, as a common term in our language, and AI-enabled devices are playing critical role in our everyday life. They are used almost everywhere, maybe without you knowing about it. For instance, did you know that AI is used in many games that you are playing, to control Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or bots, like in Fortnite or any other game? Did you know that AI is even is used in our smart phones to talk to Siri, for example? In fact, almost everything you see or do at any moment are enabled by AI to some degree. The book you are reading, yes, this book, has been a product of AI enabled computer programs. AI have been part of entire life-cycle of every product of modern civilization. Feel free to point to anything you may see at this time, we are sure that AI-enabled technologies, environments, etc. have been part of the production process. These are not limited to the games you play, or smart phones you use.\nWhen AI was first introduced; it was to make human's job more efficient. Now, more and more AI-enabled devices, AI-enabled processes and environments are making our lives easier and enjoyable. In this book, we give examples and facts about AI to humans: AI is actually \"saving\" human life, during crises and pandemics, like this COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, AI can be our super heroes that try to protect and keep us safe by being used in different ways. Therefore, to truly appreciate AI, we need to learn about it. It is also possible for you to be a super hero, like Sun Wukong (孙悟空) or Batman, and use AI to save lives in the future. However, as a first step, we need to understand AI together and learn how it can be a super hero. Therefore, this book attempts to explain in an easy and fun way, the basics of AI. It also presents vivid stories from different countries about how AI is being used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nLet’s finish reading this book and get ready to be a super hero in the future!\n\n\n\nCoronavirus (/kəˈroʊnəˌvaɪrəs/)\n\n\n\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\n\n\n\nStory 1: The AI history \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) goes back to a time far, far away from this time, when there were no smart phones, no internet, and no fast cars. Philosophers started studying the human body and its structure, and described human thinking as a symbolic system. Ancient Greeks had myths about robots, while Egyptians built some automated systems (systems that work on their own), but back then, the term “Artificial Intelligence” did not exist.  In 1952, Arthur Samuel, surprised the world, by making the first computer checkers-playing program and the first computer program to learn on its own. This computer was way bigger than computers we know nowadays (see Figure 3). After several years, specifically in 1956, the term “Artificial Intelligence” was finally coined at a conference at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire-, United States. Three years later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab was built. Later, with the help of newly invented technology, such as the Internet and smart chips, AI started to become more helpful and easier to use. Now, we can see AI with us wherever we go (like hospitals) and in things we use every day (like our smart phones).\n\n\n\nSymbolic (/sɪmˈbɒlɪk/) System (/ˈsɪstəm/)\n\n\n\n\nA system that computes and communicates using symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram (/ˈproʊgræm, -grəm/)\n\n\n\n\nA set of coded instructions that make a computer perform an operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 3.

If you understand the process of Coal mining or Oil mining, try to come up your OWN definition of Data mining and compare it to the textbook definition of data mining.\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/Chapter 2 Perception How computers recognize the world like humans do.html":{"url":"content/Chapter 2 Perception How computers recognize the world like humans do.html","title":"Chapter 2 Perception: How computers recognize the world like humans do?","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2 Perception: How computers recognize the world like humans do? \nPerception is one of the most important abilities for human and some animals.

Small babies need to recognize the faces of their parents from other faces so they can connect to them. In this context, babies start staring and seeing their parents’ faces (for instance, during breastfeeding) until they memorize them. They can then start seeing the difference between their parents’ faces and unfamiliar faces. Similarly, computers mimic human behavior and intelligence and, instead of using human eyes, they use sensors (cameras) to identify faces. Facial recognition is based on the geometric characteristics of the face (the shape of eyes, nose, mouth and the geometric relationship between them (the distance between them).\n\n\n\nGeometric (/ˌdʒiəˈmɛtrɪk/) Characteristics (/ˌkærɪktəˈrɪstɪks/)\n\n\n\n\nThey are visual characteristics that made up of shapes such as squares, triangles, or rectangles.\n\n\n\nFacial recognition involves, as shown in Figure 5, the following four steps.\n\nFace Detection: Locate one or more faces in the image and mark with a bounding box.\n\nFace Alignment: Normalize the face to be consistent with the database, such as geometry and photometrics.\n\nFeature Extraction: Select features from the face that can be used for the recognition task.\n\nFace Recognition: Compare the face to one or more known faces in a prepared database.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 5. Face detection process\n\n\n\n\n\nFacial (/ˈfeɪʃəl/) Recognition (/ˌrɛk əgˈnɪʃən/)\n\n\n\n\nFacial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.\n\n\n\nStory 2: Using robots for face mask detection during COVID-19 \n“Your temperature is normal. Please wear a mask”, say AIMBOT. AIMBOT is an intelligent patrol robot that reports and reminds people to wear a mask, as shown in Figure 6. When multiple people enter together, it can also conduct multiple face detections and mask identifications. Then it can remind everyone to keep practicing social distancing in order to reduce the risk of infection. How can AIMBOT do this? Even humans cannot measure their body temperature with only their eyes. It uses an infrared sensor in addition to its visible light binocular camera (like human eyes) to identify the visitor's mask on their faces and body temperature.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 6. A photo of AIMBOT being in use\n\n\n\n\n\nInfrared (/ˌɪnfrəˈrɛd/)\n\n\n\n\nIt is a type of light that cannot be seen with the naked eye, but can be felt in the form of heat.\n\n\n\nStory 3: Using face recognition for tracking quarantine evaders during COVID-19 \nThe COVID-19 virus is very tricky. After infecting people, it has an incubation period of about 14 days in the body. An “incubation period” means the amount of time it takes before a person starts showing symptoms, like a fever, or coughing. An incubation period of 14 days means a person can have the virus for two whole weeks before they realize it.  You may be worried and asking yourself, \"How can I tell if I'm surrounded by infected people? Especially if they do not have any symptoms? How many people are in close contact with them? \" Bingo! People's mobile trajectory data can tell us! The trajectory data can tell you where the patient has been and whether you've been there. For example, the Beijing JianKang APP uses the camera to detect the person’s face. It then shows the current status of that person. As shown in Figure 7, the green word indicates that the health of that person is good, while the yellow word indicates that the person should be home quarantined. Many supermarkets, parks and other public places in China used this APP to allow only those who are healthy to enter these places to protect more people.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 7: Screenshot of JianKang application\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubation (/ˌɪnkyəˈbeɪʃən, ˌɪŋ-/) Period (/ˈpɪəriəd/)\n\n\n\n\nThe period of time between harmful bacteria or viruses entering a person's or animal's body, or entering a plant, and the symptoms of a disease appearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile (/ˈmoʊbəl, -baɪl/) Trajectory (/trəˈdʒɛktəri/) Data (/ˈdeɪ tə, ˈdætə, ˈdɑtə/)\n\n\n\n\nData that show the curved path of somebody or something moving from one place to another.\n\n\n\nThe following challenges can make it difficult for computers to recognize a face.\n\nPose variations: It is sometimes difficult for humans to recognize others, for instance, their friends when they are looking at them from different angles. Similarly, head movements, which can be described by the egocentric rotation angles, i.e. pitch, roll and yaw, or camera changing point of views could lead to major changes in facial appearance and/or shape and generate individual variations (differences), making automated facial recognition across pose a difficult task for computers.\n\n\n\n\nVariation (/ˌvɛəriˈeɪʃən/)\n\n\n\n\nA change in the amount or level of something.\n\n\n\n\nFacial expression changes: Even more differences could be caused by a person making different facial expressions. A person might change their face because they are in different emotional states (happy, angry, confused, etc.) like the ones in Figure 8.  So, efficiently and automatically recognizing the different facial expressions is important for both the evaluation of emotional states and the automated face recognition.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 8. Face expressions based on different emotional states\n\n\n\nAging of the face: Another reason of face appearance's changes could be caused by the aging of the human face, and could impact on the entire process if the time between each image capture is significant.\n\nVarying illumination conditions: It is sometimes difficult for humans to identify others when it is a bit dark (for instance at night). Similarly, large variations of light and dark could degrade the performance of recognizing a given face. Indeed, for low levels of lighting of the background or foreground, face detection and recognition are much harder to perform, since shadows could appear on the face and facial patterns could look the same, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 9.

They can hear the difference from their voices and strangers’ voices, so they might find more comfort from their parents’ voices than a stranger’s voice. However, unlike humans, computers do not have ears that let them hear sounds, or brains to understand that the sounds are words or phrases. Therefore, they use sensors, like voice detectors (just like the human ears), to detect speech. Specifically, there are three main stages involved in speech recognition:\n\nPreprocessing involves taking the speech sounds and turning it into something the computer can use. Specifically, when we speak, we create vibrations in the air. The computer then uses an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to translate this analog wave into digital data that it can understand. To do this, it samples, or digitizes, the sound by taking precise measurements of the sound wave at frequent intervals (see Figure 10).\n\nDuring the recognition stage, the computer must identify what has been said. In this context, it starts analyzing the data also known as waves (obtained from the first step) and comparing it with already stored data of other words to identify what the user said.\n\nDuring the communication stage, the computer acts upon the translated input.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 10: Speech recognition process\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech (/spitʃ/) Recognition (/ˌrɛkəgˈnɪʃən/)\n\n\n\n\nSpeech recognition develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.

The AI-enabled solution works by quickly answering the customer's call without making the customer wait. It can also automatically classify calls and resolve common problems without any manual intervention, and classify calls based on subject and urgency, so companies can prioritize follow-up issues to solve more complex issues.\nAs the measures to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic have led to the temporary closure of some mission-critical call centers around the world, consumers are facing long waits as companies struggle to cope with the surge in call volume. This is where the artificial intelligence voice reactor comes to the rescue and diverts high call volumes and answers common questions, quickly solving common support problems without a live agent.\nFor example, the artificial intelligence outbound services of Baidu and iFlytek, as leading providers of artificial intelligence services, can benefit as call centers that are under tremendous pressure due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. At present, the company’s customer service dialogue AI platform can immediately solve problems over the phone, improve customer experiences and reduce costs.\nUnlike previous generations of IVRs (Interactive Voice Responses), voice responders can understand natural language and enable callers to talk as if they were talking to a living agent. The IVR system accepts mixed voice phone input and key-key keyboard selection, and provides related responses in the form of voice, fax, call back, email and other contact methods. On the other hand, artificial intelligence voice responders are used to help users solve basic hardware problems of commercial products and replace the affected offshore call centers. In addition, voice AI solutions ask questions to identify problems, provide relevant solutions through text, and follow up if the problem is not resolved.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 11. AI voice responder process\n\n\nStory 5: Using psychological consultant robot during COVID-19 \nTwo middle school students Thomas and Lee are talking the news released by Carnegie Mellon University (See Figure 12). \"Did you hear that Carnegie Mellon University is working on COVID-19 detection in human voice?\" \"Ah! Isn't that possible?\" \"Don't put limits on the technology. Imagine that if it works, it's certainly better to reduce the risk of infection when people go out to get tested.\" “Yeah. Looking forward to it”. It determines the probability of a user being infected by analyzing his/her voice and comparing it with the voice characteristics of people who are infected with the COVID-19. Sure, until now this application is not a diagnostic system\" and has not been approved by the FDA or CDC and therefore it should not be used as a substitute for medical examination by a health professional.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 12.

For instance, to learn how to ride a bike, we start learning how to use the bicycle pedals, have balance and use the brakes when needed. After several tries, we can decide when to pedal fast and when to coast, when to apply the brakes and when not. With the advances of technology, researchers are now trying to make computers think, do reasoning and make decisions like humans. Knowledge representation and reasoning is the field of AI aimed to make computers intelligent by representing information about the world in a form that they can use to make reasoning and decisions like humans. For instance, we can give computers the location of several places (e.g., restaurants, shops, etc.) as a data point and then computers can do reasoning to select the shortest path from the current location to the location that the user wants to go to.\nThree methods of reasoning are the deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches. Deductive reasoning starts with the assertion of general rule and proceeds from there to a guaranteed specific conclusion. Deductive reasoning moves from the general rule to the specific application: In deductive reasoning, if the original assertions are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, math is deductive:\n\nif x = 2and if y = 5then 3x + y = 11\n\nInductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence. You could say that inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. For example, Paul always leaves his home to go to school at 7:00 AM, and he is always on time. Paul then assumes that if he leaves at 7:00 AM for school today, he will be on time.\nAbductive reasoning typically begins with an incomplete set of observations and proceeds to the likeliest possible explanation for the set. Abductive reasoning yields the kind of daily decision-making that does its best with the information at hand, which often is incomplete. For example:\n\nPremise 1: You arrived home and were surprised that the front door was open (X)Premise 2: However, if your son had arrived home before you, this would be unsurprising (If Y, then unsurprisingly X)Premise 3: Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that your son opened the door. (therefore, presumably Z).\n\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/3.1 Utilizing medical clinic diagnosis during COVID-19.html":{"url":"content/3.1 Utilizing medical clinic diagnosis during COVID-19.html","title":"3.1 Utilizing medical clinic diagnosis during COVID-19","keywords":"","body":"3.1 Utilizing medical clinic diagnosis during COVID-19 \nIn the past, doctors needed long-term training to conduct professional diagnosis.

First of all, AI is used to perform basic screening and judgment, and then doctors can do control and correction, to guarantee the safety of the patients and improve the time to treatment for the patients.\nStory 6: Intelligent chest evaluation system of COVID-19 \nThe new chest computed tomography (CT) coronavirus pneumonia (see Figure 14) is an intelligent evaluation system. It can quickly screen suspected patients and assist medical institutions to quickly shunt patients. It includes the following features:\n\nIntelligent detection: the traditional method of detecting lesion areas requires doctors to manually outline the ROI, which is inefficient and difficult to promote, while the use of artificial intelligence can achieve rapid automatic detection of lesions, greatly improving efficiency.\nIntelligent analysis: The AI system enables dynamic 4D comparison of the whole lung lesion in CT, and quantitative analysis of the severity of pneumonia in 2-3 seconds.\nIntelligent follow-up: intelligent follow-up analysis of the patient's disease course, accurate matching of historical images, automatic analysis of disease metastasis and development.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 14.

What kind of services can they provide? The solution includes remote patient progress monitoring, automated patient queries, provider-facing alerts about high-risk patients, and daily updates about the spread and progress of the disease at a community and regional level. Definitely, more improvement needs to be done to make it more efficient.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 15.

Is it possible to predict if a patient will require additional interventions prior to the onset of symptoms, so as to carry out early prevention in order to save more lives? Some hospitals have begun to experiment AI technologies, where these technologies learn from existing data to find similar patterns and then uses those patterns to make predictions about the future. For instance, new algorithms are now being developed to determine which mildly ill patients are likely to become severely ill. In doing so, these algorithms also found some unexpected early clinical signs that predict severe cases of COVID-19.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 16.

In augmented reality, a 3D representation of the world must be constructed to allow digital objects to exist alongside physical ones. Visual data is used along with an accelerometer and gyroscopes to build a map of the world and track movement within it. Most of these tasks are still done using traditional computer vision techniques that make no use of machine learning.\nIndependently, however, AI models have gotten incredibly good at doing many of the things required to build immersive AR experiences. Deep neural networks can detect vertical and horizontal planes, estimate depth and segment images for realistic occlusion, and even infer 3D positions of objects in real-time.

Have you experienced AR or VR? What do you think of these emerging technologies especially during this pandemic? AR and VR technologies are emerging as effective solutions in this time as they enable people to connect with others virtually. The pandemic has also brought opportunities for telemedicine or telehealth platforms that are able to offer both patients and care providers a different experience while delivering treatment. These technologies provide engagement for the users, patients and doctors. JD Health, a subsidiary of e-commerce giant JD.com, saw a tenfold growth in monthly consultations for its online health platform during the coronavirus epidemic. In addition, a provider of extended reality and therapeutic applications XRHealth is developing VR telehealth support in its response to prevent the spread of the virus. So, as businesses are suffering due to the spread of COVID-19, such immersive technologies are emerging as their rescue solutions helping them to keep sustain and improve their business profitability not only during the pandemic, but also post-crisis era.

The method is to make the decision by decision tree. What is a decision tree?  \n\n\n\nDecision (/dɪˈsɪʒən/) Tree (/tri/)\n\n\n\n\nDecision trees are one of the most popular and powerful machine learning algorithms. It is used to determine a set of actions or show a statistical probability. Each branch of the decision tree represents a possible decision, outcome, or reaction. The farthest branches on the tree represent the end results.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons why decision trees are so powerful is that they can be easily visualized so that a human can understand what is going on. Imagine a flowchart, where each level is a question with a yes or no answer. Eventually an answer will give you a solution to the initial problem. That is a decision tree. Everybody subconsciously uses decision trees all the time for most menial tasks. Decision trees in machine learning take that ability and multiply it to be able to artificially perform complex decision-making tasks.\nThe decision tree analyses a dataset in order to construct a set of rules, or questions, which are used to predict a class. Let us consider a dataset consisting of lots of different animals and some of their characteristics. These characteristics can be used to predict their class. If we take a falcon and a tiger, a question that would split these two animals would be ‘Does this animal have feathers?’ or perhaps ‘Does this animal lay eggs?’. The answer no for either of these questions would lead to the classification of a tiger, whereas yes would be a falcon. These rules can be built up to create a model that can classify complex situations. To extend the animal classification example, consider the scenario of needing to classify a selection of animals into mammals, reptile, or insects. Look at the visualized decision tree (see Figure 17) to see how two simple questions can be used to split the data. These simple questions layered one after another, allow the classification of a wide range of animals. This is the power of decision trees. Now if we give the trained decision tree a new animal, for example a snake, it will classify it. Does a snake have vertebra? Yes. Is a snake cold-blooded? Yes. Therefore, the model will classify it as a reptile, the correct answer!\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 17. Decision tree to classify animals into mammals, reptile, or insects\n\n\nWhen a human construct a decision tree, the questions and answers are based on their logic and knowledge. In data science the creation of these rules is usually governed by an algorithm learning which questions to ask by analyzing the entire dataset. To put this into context we will come back to the animal example, the algorithm will look at all the animals to figure out that all animals that do not breathe air are all fish. This mathematically splits the dataset by its class. This creates powerful algorithms that can classify new data into classes in a way that any human can understand. Decision trees can become much more powerful when used as ensembles. Ensembles are clever ways of combining decision trees to create a more powerful model. These ensembles create state of the art machine learning algorithms that can outperform neural networks in some cases. The two most popular ensemble techniques are random forests and gradient boosting.\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn.externals.six import StringIO\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nfrom pydot import graph_from_dot_data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nAccordingly, Let's take a look at how we could go about implementing a decision tree classifier in Python.

Besides, we used the following library as the handy tool.\niris = load_iris()\nX = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)\ny = pd.Categorical.from_codes(iris.target, iris.target_names)\n\nIn the proceeding section, we will attempt to build a decision tree classifier to determine the kind of flower given its dimensions.\nX.head()\n\n\nAlthough, decision trees can handle categorical data, we still encode the targets in terms of digits (i.e. setosa=0, versicolor=1, virginica=2) in order to create a confusion matrix at a later point. Fortunately, the pandas library provides a method for this very purpose.\ny = pd.get_dummies(y)\n\nWe’ll want to evaluate the performance of our model. Therefore, we set a quarter of the data aside for testing.\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)\n\nNext, we create and train an instance of the DecisionTreeClassifer class. We provide the y values because our model using a supervised machine learning algorithm.\ndt = DecisionTreeClassifier()\ndt.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nWe can view the actual decision tree produced by our model by running the following block of code.\ndot_data = StringIO()\nexport_graphviz(dt, out_file=dot_data, feature_names=iris.feature_names)\n(graph, ) = graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue()) Image(graph.create_png())\n\nNotice how it provides the Gini impurity, the total number of samples, the classification criteria and the number of samples on the left/right sides.\nTest\nTest the code below with username yuanzhuo and password yuanzhuo.

This is known as machine learning. Machine learning uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes. For instance, as shown in Figure 18, in an online shopping website, the machine will learn the preferences or choices of a particular customer by recording the products that he/she has bought or went through. It will then start recommending to the customer based on these preferences.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 20. A computer learning about a shopper from his data\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, four types of learning could be implemented:\n\n1.**Supervised learning**: In this learning type, the machine learning model is taught some knowledge in advance so it can predict future instances. To simplify this definition, we want the machine to know if the student X is a hardworking, good or lazy student based on: **(1)** how many learning hours he/she spends per day; **(2)** how many hours he/she watches the TV. As we mentioned, we need to first teach the machine; in this case we have to give it previous knowledge (also known as labeled dataset) about other students, as shown in Table 1. As you can see in the knowledge given in Table 1, the type of student is known (hard working, good, lazy). The machine will first learn from this knowledge. It will then classify any new student (for instance, our student X) based on how many hours, he/she spent learning and watching TV.\n\n\nTable 1. Example of knowledge information (also known as labeled dataset) to classify a student\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\nLearning hours\nTV watching hours\nType of student\n\n\n\n\nAdam\n5\n1\nHard working\n\n\nSarra\n3\n2\nGood student\n\n\nCharlie\n2\n3\nLazy student\n\n\n\n2.Unsupervised learning: In this learning type, we do not teach the machine learning model (like in the first case). Hence, the machine will work on unlabeled data and it will classify or cluster this data based on similar patterns or features.\n3.Reinforcement learning: In this learning type, an agent will be within an interactive environment and in a specific state. It will then learn from its own actions and experiences by trial and error using feedback from the environment. To simplify this, we take the example of “fetch the ball” game between the dog and its owner (See Figure 19). The dog (agent) will be in the garden with its owner (interactive environment) where the owner throws the ball (state). The dog (agent) has to perform an action which could be running after the ball or not. If the dog fetches the ball (action), its owner (interactive environment) will reward him by giving him food, in this way the dog (agent) will know that he is doing the right action and he should keep doing that. If the dog does not bring the ball (action), its owner will not give him food. In this way, the dog (agent) will know that it is doing the wrong action, and it should go bring the ball (correct action)\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 21. “Fetch the ball” game between the dog and its owner\n\n\n4.Deep learning: Deep learning is a specific method of machine learning that incorporates neural networks in successive layers in order to learn from data in an iterative manner. Deep learning is especially useful when you are trying to learn patterns from unstructured data.\nJust like we have seen above, machine learning can learn and make predictions based on the given data. Therefore, it is important to give the machine: (1) good quality data: which means accurate and correct data that can help the machine takes correct decisions; and, (2) big amount of data which can help the machine learns several information that can help it perform several actions and decisions. To simplify this, we can consider the machine as the “car” and the data as the “fuel” (See Figure 20). So, the car cannot work without the fuel, same for the machine, it cannot work without the data. Also, if we give too much good quality fuel to the car, the engine then will not be harmed and the car can take us on a long trip. Same for the machine, accurate data, will not harm the machine and make it take correct decisions, and too much data will make it take several decisions or predictions.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 22. Importance of data for machine learning\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer (/kəmˈpyutər/) data (/ˈdeɪtə, ˈdætə, ˈdɑtə/)\n\n\n\n\nComputer data is information processed or stored by a computer. This information can be in different forms, such as text, audio, or image. Computer data is processed by the computer's Central Processing Uunit (CPU) and can be stored on the computer's hard disk or online, on the cloud.\n\n\n\nThere is an urgent need for hospitals and relevant departments at all levels to establish interactive information interfaces and connections, as well as a platform for all parties to collaborate and share information in real time, so that information and data can be shared among medical institutions and between medical institutions and regional administrative departments in accordance with their mandates, providing an effective basis for management and decision-making. In this context, the most important thing is to provide a unified and structured data platform, so that doctors and researchers can easily access to international and updated data. For instance, as shown in Figure 21, COVID-19 surveillance platform was established by Ningbo medical health committee, China in the early 2020, and it could be used to monitor the 4000 medical institutions in Ningbo. All of the data, such confirmed cases, age of infected patients, etc. come from the Yindu Cloud in China.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 23.

The hidden layers in a CNN are generally convolution and pooling (downsampling) layers. In each convolution layer, we take a filter of a small size and move that filter across the image and perform convolution operations. Convolution operations are nothing but element-wise matrix multiplication between the filter values and the pixels in the image and the resultant values are summed.\n\n\n\nCNN: Convolution (/ˌkɒnvəˈluʃən/) Neural (/ˈnʊərəl/) Network (/ ˈnɛtˌwɜrk/)\n\n\n\n\nCNN is a convolutional neural network is a feed-forward neural network that is generally used to analyze visual images by processing data with grid-like topology. It’s also known as a ConvNet. Generally, a convolutional neural network is used to detect and classify objects in an image.\n\n\n\nCNN is also computationally efficient. It uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs parameter sharing. This enables CNN models to run on any device, making them universally attractive. All in this sounds like pure magic. We are dealing with a very powerful and efficient model which performs automatic feature extraction to achieve superhuman accuracy. All CNN models follow a similar architecture, as shown in Figure 25.\n\n\n    \n    \n    FFigure 25. CNN architecture\n\n\nNow, let’s move on to pooling layers. Pooling layers are used to downsize the image. The image would contain a lot of pixel values and it is typically easy for the network to learn the features if the image size is progressively reduced. Pooling layers help in reducing the number of parameters required and hence, this reduces the computation required. Pooling also helps in avoiding overfitting. There are two types of pooling operation that could be done:\n\nMax Pooling — Selecting the maximum value\nAverage Pooling — Sum all of the values and dividing it by the total number of values\n\nBefore we start coding, I would like to let you know that the dataset we are going to use is the MNIST digits dataset and we are going to use the Keras library with a Tensorflow backend for building the model. Ok, enough. Let’s do some coding.\nimport keras\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten\nfrom keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2Dimport numpy as np\n\nFirst, let us do some necessary imports. The keras library helps us build our convolutional neural network. We download the mnist dataset through keras. We import a sequential model, which is a pre-built keras model where you can add the layers. We introduce the convolution and pooling layers. We also import dense layers as they are used to predict the labels. The dropout layer reduces overfitting and the flattening layer expands a three-dimensional vector into a one-dimensional vector. Finally, we import numpy for matrix operations.\nbatch_size = 128\nnum_classes = 10\nepochs = 12\n# input image dimensions\nimg_rows, img_cols = 28, 28\n# the data, split between train and test sets\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\nx_train = x_train.reshape(60000,28,28,1)\nx_test = x_test.reshape(10000,28,28,1)\nprint('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)\nprint(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')\nprint(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')\n# convert class vectors to binary class matrices\ny_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)\ny_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)\n\nMost of the statements in the above code would be trivial, I would just explain some lines of the code. We reshape x_train and x_test because our CNN accepts only a four-dimensional vector. The value 60000 represents the number of images in the training data, 28 represents the image size and one represents the number of channels. The number of channels is set to one if the image is in grayscale and if the image is in RGB format, the number of channels is set to three. We also convert our target values into binary class matrices. To know what binary class matrices look like take a look at the example below.\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),  activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))\nmodel.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.25))\nmodel.add(Flatten())\nmodel.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))\n\nWe build a sequential model and add convolutional layers and max pooling layers to it. We also add dropout layers in between, dropout randomly switches off some neurons in the network which forces the data to find new paths. Therefore, this reduces overfitting. We add dense layers at the end which are used for class prediction(0–9).\nmodel.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,              optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),  metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.fit(x_train, y_train,          batch_size=batch_size,          epochs=epochs,          verbose=1,          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))\nscore = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint('Test loss:', score[0])\nprint('Test accuracy:', score[1])\n\nWe now compile the model with a categorical cross entropy loss function, Adadelta optimizer and an accuracy metric. We then fit the dataset to the model, i.e we train the model for 12 epochs. After training the model, we evaluate the loss and accuracy of the model on the test data and print it (see Figure 24).\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 26.

For example, we can mention the case of Siri which is a smart virtual assistant developed by Apple Inc (see several examples in Figure 27). It uses voice queries and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of internet services.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 27. Examples of smart virtual assistants that can interact with humans\n\n\nTo conduct natural language interaction and communicate with humans, a machine conducts the following steps: (1) take the human input, such as speech; (2) analyze the input (speech) to understand what a person is trying to say; (3) do the reasoning process to provide an accurate answer or perform a task; and, (4) perform the action, by answering the user back or executing a specific task. To deliver an intelligent, humanlike experience, a machine should use a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) principles and technologies. For instance, Figure 28 shows a communication scenario between a human and a virtual assistant to play a specific music.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 28.  A communication scenario between a human and a virtual assistant to play a specific music\n\n\nNLP is defined as the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech. In other words: the use of different techniques from computer science (algorithms) to understand and manipulate human language and speech. NLP has the following two main components:\n\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU): It revolves around machine reading comprehension. This is an AI-hard problem. An NLU system needs the following components: (1) Lexicon, Parser, and Grammar rules; and, (2) Semantic theory to guide comprehension.\n\nNatural Language Generation (NLG) is concerned with generating natural language. It uses a machine representation system like a knowledge base or a logical form. You can think of it as a translator between data and natural language representation; this is the opposite of NLU. This involves three tasks: (1) Text Planning- To extract relevant content from the knowledge base; (2) Sentence Planning- To choose appropriate words, form meaningful phrases, and set sentence tone; and, (3) Text Realization- To map the sentence plan into sentence structure.\n\n\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/5.1 Smart chatbots to answer users’ inquiries about COVID-19.html":{"url":"content/5.1 Smart chatbots to answer users’ inquiries about COVID-19.html","title":"5.1 Smart chatbots to answer users’ inquiries about COVID-19","keywords":"","body":"5.1 Smart chatbots to answer users’ inquiries about COVID-19 \nA chatbot is a computer program that allows humans to interact with technology using a variety of input methods such as voice, text, gesture and touch. It is known by several names, including as a conversational AI bot, AI chatbot, AI assistant, intelligent virtual assistant, virtual customer assistant, digital assistant, conversational agent, virtual agent, conversational interface and more, chatbots are growing in popularity. The chatbot uses NLP (see previous section) to analyze the text input, considers the best response and delivers that back to the user. For instance, it is possible to try the chatbot Elbot (https://www.elbot.com/). Smart chatbots, also known as AI chatbots, should have the following capabilities.\n\nIntelligent Understanding is more than just correctly interpreting the user’s request. It’s about being able to instantly merge other pieces of information such as geolocation or previous preferences into the conversation to deliver a more complete answer.\n\nMemory allows a chatbot to remember pertinent details to reuse during a conversation or implicitly learn about a person to be reused later. For example, a mobile assistant might learn through previous requests and responses that the user clearly prefers Italian cuisine and so will use this information when asked for restaurant recommendations in future.\n\nSentiment analysis enables a chatbot to understand the mood of the customer and the strength of that feeling. This is particularly important in customer service type applications where it can be linked to complaint escalation flows, but also can be used in other more trivial ways such as choosing which songs to play upon request.\n\nPersonality can make a huge difference to engagement and the trust users place in the chatbot. While some companies chose to reinforce it using avatars, personality can easily be conveyed in the conversation alone.\n\nPersistence allows people to pick up a conversation where they last left off, even if they switch devices, making for a more natural and seamless user experience.\n\nTopic switching enables the user to veer off onto another subject, such as asking about payment methods while enquiring if a product is in stock. The chatbot should also then be capable of bringing the user back on track if the primary intent is not reached.\n\n\nStory 12: Human-Robot to clean hospitals during COVID-19 \nCan you guess what the robot is doing (see Figure 29)? Yes, the robot is cleaning at the city state's Alexandra Hospital-Singapore. The robot can stop automatically when someone approaches from the opposite direction. It is popular at the hospital and some patients even wave at her. Remember to say “hello” to the robot when you see it.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 29.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to solve and better understand the information crisis of the new coronavirus pandemic and to measure public sentiment in order to implement appropriate information transmission and policy decisions.\nUsing natural language processing, researchers can monitor popular online comment boards to better understand public concerns during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nPublic health officials can use natural language manipulation technology to track the topic of COVID-19 that has surged in interest on online forums. These insights can help policy makers understand public health/organizational concerns and priorities, while reducing the spread of misinformation. Real-time analysis of public response can make people aware of changes in public priorities, fluctuations in health conditions, and the adoption of public health measures, all of which will have an impact on individual and group levels of health.\nStory 14: COVID-19 Public Sentiment Insights and Machine Learning for Tweets Classification \nHow people feel during this pandemic? This is a very complicated task as billions of people exist worldwide. However, nothing is impossible with AI. On June 11, 2020, a study by the University of Charleston determined public sentiment related to the pandemic through the Twitter and internal resistance health statistics software of the Coronavirus Group Health Organization, and sentiment analysis software. Through the use of descriptive text analysis and necessary text data visualization technology, they have proved that over time, as the new coronavirus pneumonia in the United States approaches its peak, the development of fear also reaches its peak (see Figures 31 and 32).\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 31: An instance of word cloud in twitter data\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Figure 32: A couple of word cloud instances\n\n\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/5.3 Hands-on learning experience Sentence tokenization.html":{"url":"content/5.3 Hands-on learning experience Sentence tokenization.html","title":"5.3 Hands-on learning experience: Sentence tokenization","keywords":"","body":"5.3 Hands-on learning experience: Sentence tokenization \nWhen we talk about the natural language processing, we can learn how to handle the sentence tokenization and formulate document vector firstly. Sentence tokenization (also called sentence segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component sentences. The idea here seems very simple. In English and some other languages, we can split apart the sentences whenever we see a punctuation mark. However, even in English, this problem is not trivial due to the use of full stop character for abbreviations. When processing plain text, tables of abbreviations that contain periods can help us to prevent incorrect assignment of sentence boundaries. In many cases, we use libraries to do that job for us, so don’t worry too much for the details for now.\nFor example, let’s look a piece of text about a famous board game called backgammon. It's “Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East. It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice.”\nTo apply a sentence tokenization with NLTK we can use the nltk.sent_tokenize function.\ntext = \"Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East. It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice.\"\nsentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)\nfor sentence in sentences:\n    print(sentence)\n    print()\n\nAs an output, we get the three component sentences separately.\nBackgammon is one of the oldest known board games.\nIts history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East.\nIt is a two-player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice.\n\nAccordingly, we can learn how to process bag-of-word and count the document vector. The bag-of-words model is a popular and simple feature extraction technique used when we work with text. It describes the occurrence of each word within a document.\nTo use this model, we need to:\n\nDesign a vocabulary of known words (also called tokens)\n\nChoose a measure of the presence of known words\n\n\nAny information about the order or structure of words is discarded. That’s why it’s called a bag of words. This model is trying to understand whether a known word occurs in a document, but don’t know where is that word in the document. The intuition is that similar documents have similar contents. Also, via the content, we can learn something about the meaning of the document. There are two steps.\n1. Load the Data\nWe have a reviews.txt file, it is our data and we want to load it as an array. The file content is:\n\nI like this movie, it's funny. I hate this movie. This was awesome! I like it. Nice one. I love it.\n\nTo achieve this we can simply read the file and split it by lines.\nwith open(\"simple movie reviews.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    documents = file.read().splitlines()\nprint(documents)\n\nThe output is\n'I like this movie, it's funny.', 'I hate this movie.', 'This was awesome! I like it.', 'Nice one. I love it.'\n\n2. Design the Vocabulary\nLet’s get all the unique words from the four loaded sentences ignoring the case, punctuation, and one-character tokens. These words will be our vocabulary (known words). Thus, we need to score the words in each document. The task here is to convert each raw text into a vector of numbers. The simplest scoring method is to mark the presence of words with one for present and zero for absence.\nNow, let’s see how we can create a bag-of-words model using the mentioned above CountVectorizer class.\n# Import the libraries we need\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text\nimport CountVectorizerimport pandas as pd\n\n# Step 2. Design the Vocabulary\n# The default token pattern removes tokens of a single character. That's why we don't have the \"I\" and \"s\" tokens in the output\ncount_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n\n# Step 3. Create the Bag-of-Words Model\nbag_of_words = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\n\n# Show the Bag-of-Words Model as a pandas DataFrame\nfeature_names = count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()\npd.DataFrame(bag_of_words.toarray(), columns = feature_names)\n\nOur output is shown as follows,\n\nWe can compare to our text content, this learning can be denoted as the basic introduction of natural language processing.\n\nI like this movie, it's funny.I hate this movie.This was awesome! I like it.Nice one. I love it.\n\nTest\nTest the code below with username yuanzhuo and password yuanzhuo. Please choose kernel conda-yuanzhuo.

AI systems can be of great service to humanity, but also raises fundamental concerns. For instance, we can talk about artificial stupidity, racist robots, discrimination, job loss etc.  The following AI examples can be found that someone should know and consider while developing AI-based solutions.\n\nInaccurate data while training AI systems can lead to inaccurate or unfair decisions for some people. For instance, the system may not detect that someone is infected with COVID-19 when he/she is infected. This can put his/her life and the life of others in danger.\n\nAI systems should consider the privacy of persons (patients) while treating them in order to keep their information safe and protect their private lives.\n\nThe data generated by AI systems can be stored in different servers (e.g. hospital servers, institution servers, etc.), therefore someone may ask if this data belongs to the person (patient) since the system used his/her data, or to the developer/company because it developed the system or to the third party (hospitals, institutions, etc.) since they provided the servers for data collection and processing. Data ownership is a big issue in the field of AI that should be considered.\n\nTransparency of how AI systems work, including algorithms, data collection and processing is another issue that should be considered.\n\n\nAs shown in this book, AI adoption, especially in health care, is very useful, but still complex due to the social and ethical issues presented above. Whether AI is good or bad can be examined from several perspectives. Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind these issues while analyzing the broader societal issues at play. It is important need to keep learning and stay informed in order to make good decisions for our future.\nFurthermore, it is clearly that AI and other emerging technologies, such as robotics, will take over several jobs in the future to make the work automated and faster (Internet of Business, n.d.). However, AI will also open up new opportunities for new jobs that did not exist before. These jobs will require new skills and new knowledge that were not needed long time ago, such as Python, React (web), Angular, machine learning, and Docker (Columbus, 2019). It is seen that several institutions and schools are now updating their curriculum to keep with AI technologies. Therefore, it is very important to keep learning about AI and its related technologies for a better future career.\nQuiz\nPlease select the correct statement:\\n\",\"hint\":\"Poor Pluto ... -->\",\"count\":4,\"id\":\"ea01bc37e0374eb5d1178e7bbb29239fd9fd3c14\"}\" data-id=\"ea01bc37e0374eb5d1178e7bbb29239fd9fd3c14\" class=\"mcqBox gitQuestion\">Please select the correct statement:\nA.

AI researchers around the world have, over the past few years, engineered drastically new capabilities in health care, just in time to combat the novel coronavirus.\nAI has been used to fight the virus in different stages, from screening and diagnosis to vaccine development. With its ability to learn quickly from data related to COVID-19, AI has saved human beings. Physical robots also come in handy. For instance, self-navigating robots have worked to disinfect hospitals, deliver food and medication, and check body temperatures. At airports and train stations, temperature sensors are used to scan crowds for high temperatures. They are also used with a face recognition system, which can pinpoint individuals with a high temperature and whether they are wearing a surgical mask or not. This system is also being used to ensure that citizens are obeying self-quarantine regulations. Particularly, those who broke the laws and left home would get a call from the authorities, presumably after being tracked by the facial recognition system.\nTherefore, since severe crises are unlikely to disappear, it is important to prepare the young generation for the next pandemic especially in the era of AI. This could be ensured by preparing courses that could familiarize the young generation with AI background as well as its possible tasks and functionalities. In line with this, this reading book presented the basics solutions of AI in a fun and easy way, as well as vivid stories about how AI is used worldwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Finally, this reading book presented the AI challenges that should be considered in the future.\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2022-07-06\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  \nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"content/References.html":{"url":"content/References.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"References\n\nAIMBOT, https://www.ubtrobot.com/cn/products/aimbot\n\nArtificial Solutions.

**(2)** 他/她看电视的时间。正如我们所提到的，我们需要先教机器；在这种情况下，我们必须给它提供以前关于其他学生的知识（也称为标签数据集），如表1所示。在表1给出的知识中可以看到，学生的类型是已知的（勤奋、优秀、懒惰）。机器将首先从这些知识中学习。然后，它将根据任何一个想要预测的新学生（例如，我们的学生X）花了多少小时学习和看电视来进行分类。\n\n\n表 1. 对学生进行分类的知识信息（也称为标签数据集）实例\n\n\n\n\n\n学生\n学习时间\n看电视时间\n学生类型\n\n\n\n\n张强\n5\n1\n勤奋\n\n\n李明\n3\n2\n优秀\n\n\n王正\n2\n3\n懒惰\n\n\n\n2.无监督学习：在这种学习类型中，我们不提前教授机器学习模型知识（如第一种情况）。因此，机器将在未标记的数据上工作，它将根据相似的模式或特征对这些数据进行分类或聚类。\n3.强化学习：在这种学习类型中，机器将运行在一个交互环境中，并处于特定的状态。然后，它将利用环境的反馈，通过试错从自己的行动和经验中学习。我们以狗和主人之间的 \"捡球 \"游戏为例（见图21）。狗（机器）与主人（交互环境）在花园里，主人在花园里扔球（状态）。狗（机器）必须执行一个动作，可能是追球，也可能不是。如果狗捡到了球（动作），它的主人（互动环境）会通过给它食物来奖励它，通过这种方式，狗（机器）会知道它正在做正确的动作，它应该继续这样做。如果狗没有追球（动作），它的主人就不会给它食物。这样，狗（机器）就会知道自己做的动作是错误的，它应该去追球（正确的动作）。\n\n\n    \n    \n    图 21. 狗和主人之间的“捡球”游戏\n\n\n4.深度学习：深度学习是一种特殊的机器学习方法，它在连续的层中加入了神经网络，以便以重复（迭代）的方式从数据中学习。当你试图从非结构化数据中学习到某种模式时，深度学习特别有用。\n就像我们在上面看到的那样，机器学习可以根据给定的数据进行学习和预测。因此，给机器提供以下数据很重要: (1) 高质量的数据：准确和正确的数据可以帮助机器做出正确的决策; (2) 大量的数据：可以帮助机器学习到若干信息以执行动作和决策。举例来说，我们可以把机器看作是 \"汽车\"，而数据则是 \"燃料\"（见图22）。汽车没有燃料就不能工作，同样的，机器没有数据也不能工作。另外，如果我们给汽车提供大量优质的燃油，那么发动机就不会受到伤害，汽车就可以带我们远行。同样对于机器来说，高质量的数据不会对机器造成伤害，从而帮助它做出正确的决策，而大量的数据可以使它做出精确的决策或预测。\n\n\n    \n    \n    图 22. 数据对于机器学习的重要性\n\n\n\n\n\n计算机数据\n\n\n\n\n计算机数据是由计算机处理或存储的信息。这种信息可以是不同的形式，如文本、音频或图像。计算机数据由计算机的中央处理单元(CPU)处理，可以存储在计算机的硬盘或在线云端上。\n\n\n\n各级医院和相关部门迫切需要建立互动的信息接口与连接，建立各方实时协作和信息共享的平台，使医疗机构之间、医疗机构与区域行政部门之间能够按照任务规定实现信息和数据共享，为管理和决策提供有效依据。在此背景下，最重要的是提供一个统一的、结构化的数据平台，使医生和科研人员可以方便地获取国际最新数据。例如，如图23所示，中国宁波市医疗卫生委员会在2020年初建立了新冠肺炎监测平台，可以对宁波市4000家医疗机构进行监测。所有的数据，如确诊病例、感染者年龄等都来自中国的医渡云。\n\n\n    \n    \n    图 23. 宁波市医疗卫生委员会建立的新冠肺炎监测平台，数据来自医渡云\n\n\n© Smart Learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLIBNU), 2020 all right reserved，powered by GitbookRelease Date：\n2020-09-16\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };

Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East. It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice.”\ntext = \"Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games.

I hate this movie. This was awesome! I like it. Nice one. I love it.\n\n为了实现这一点，我们可以简单地读取文件，并按行分割\nwith open(\"simple movie reviews.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    documents = file.read().splitlines()\nprint(documents)\n\n输出是\n'I like this movie, it's funny.', 'I hate this movie.', 'This was awesome! I like it.', 'Nice one. I love it.'\n\n2. 设计词表\n让我们从四个句子中获取所有独特的单词，忽略大小写、标点符号和单字标记。这些词将成为我们的词表（已知词）。因此，我们需要对每个文档中的单词进行评分。这里的任务是将每个原始文本转换为数字的向量。最简单的打分方法是若该单词存在，则用1标记，若单词不存在，则用0标记。\n现在，让我们看看如何使用上面提到的CountVectorizer类创建一个词袋模型。\n# Import the libraries we need\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text\nimport CountVectorizerimport pandas as pd\n\n# Step 2. Design the Vocabulary\n# The default token pattern removes tokens of a single character. That's why we don't have the \"I\" and \"s\" tokens in the output\ncount_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n\n# Step 3. Create the Bag-of-Words Model\nbag_of_words = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\n\n# Show the Bag-of-Words Model as a pandas DataFrame\nfeature_names = count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()\npd.DataFrame(bag_of_words.toarray(), columns = feature_names)\n\n输出如下所示\n\n对照一下我们的文本内容，这种学习方式就是NLP中自然语言的基本处理方式\n\nI like this movie, it's funny.I hate this movie.This was awesome! I like it.Nice one. I love it.\n\n测试\n请在我们的jupyter服务器上测试代码并进行练习，默认账户名yuanzhuo，默认密码yuanzhuo. 请将kernel设置为conda-yuanzhuo.
