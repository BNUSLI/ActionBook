# Chapter 1 What is Artificial Intelligence? ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only about robots as shown in movies, for instance “I, Robot” movie (see Figure 2). It is much bigger than that; It has been a research area in computer science and engineering. Now, it is part of our life. There are many different types of AI. AI is about making machines, such as computers, be smart and mimic human behaviors.

| **Artificial (/ˌɑr təˈfɪʃ əl/)**
| ---
| *Something made or produced by people, often as a copy of something natural.*

| **Intelligence (/ɪnˈtɛl ɪ dʒəns/)**
| ---
| *The ability to learn, think, understand, and make decisions that are based on reasoning.*

In fact, we are interacting and communicating with 'machines' all the time, they are like one of us. The field of AI that made this possible is called speech recognition. AI-enabled computers (we also call them machines, or in some countries, we simply call them electronic brain) can now read and write text like humans, and the type of AI that allows this to happen is called Natural Language Processing (NLP). In addition to the ability of language processing, scientists have made computers do other things that are uniquely to human, we call 'higher order cognitive abilities' such as thinking, reasoning, and decision making. It has been shown that these abilities of human brain are largely due to its special interaction style between neurons (the basic elements of human brain). Scientists enable computers with these higher-order cognitive capability by implementing something called 'brain-style computation' between neural **networks**. To implement these presented examples, AI relies on analyzing **data** using several **algorithms** to achieve its objective. Figure 2 presents examples of how AI technologies could mimic human actions and behaviors.

| **Network (/ˈnɛtˌwɜrk/)**
| ---
| *A large system consisting of many similar parts, such as lines, tubes, nerves, etc. that are connected to each other and operate together.*

| **Data (/ˈdeɪtə, ˈdætə, ˈdɑtə/)**
| ---
| *Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and used to discover things or to make decisions. Data could be in different formats, such as text, picture or audio.*

| **Algorithm (/ˈælgəˌrɪðəm/)**
| ---
| *A list of instructions or a set of rules to be followed for solving a problem.*

AI, as a common term in our language, and AI-enabled devices are playing critical role in our everyday life. They are used almost everywhere, maybe without you knowing about it. For instance, did you know that AI is used in many games that you are playing, to control Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or bots, like in Fortnite or any other game? Did you know that AI is even is used in our smart phones to talk to Siri, for example? In fact, almost everything you see or do at any moment are enabled by AI to some degree. The book you are reading, yes, this book, has been a product of AI enabled computer programs. AI have been part of entire life-cycle of every product of modern civilization. Feel free to point to anything you may see at this time, we are sure that AI-enabled technologies, environments, etc. have been part of the production process. These are not limited to the games you play, or smart phones you use.

When AI was first introduced; it was to make human's job more efficient. Now, more and more AI-enabled devices, AI-enabled processes and environments are making our lives easier and enjoyable. In this book, we give examples and facts about AI to humans: AI is actually "saving" human life, during crises and pandemics, like this COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, AI can be our super heroes that try to protect and keep us safe by being used in different ways. Therefore, to truly appreciate AI, we need to learn about it. It is also possible for you to be a super hero, like Sun Wukong (孙悟空) or Batman, and use AI to save lives in the future. However, as a first step, we need to understand AI together and learn how it can be a super hero. Therefore, this book attempts to explain in an easy and fun way, the basics of AI. It also presents vivid stories from different countries about how AI is being used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Let’s finish reading this book and get ready to be a super hero in the future!

| **Coronavirus (/kəˈroʊnəˌvaɪrəs/)**
| ---
| *Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.*

#### Story 1: The AI history ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) goes back to a time far, far away from this time, when there were no smart phones, no internet, and no fast cars. Philosophers started studying the human body and its structure, and described human thinking as a **symbolic system**. Ancient Greeks had myths about robots, while Egyptians built some automated systems (systems that work on their own), but back then, the term “Artificial Intelligence” did not exist.  In 1952, Arthur Samuel, surprised the world, by making the first computer checkers-playing **program** and the first computer program to learn on its own. This computer was way bigger than computers we know nowadays (see Figure 3). After several years, specifically in 1956, the term “Artificial Intelligence” was finally coined at a conference at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire-, United States. Three years later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab was built. Later, with the help of newly invented technology, such as the Internet and smart chips, AI started to become more helpful and easier to use. Now, we can see AI with us wherever we go (like hospitals) and in things we use every day (like our smart phones).

| **Symbolic (/sɪmˈbɒlɪk/) System (/ˈsɪstəm/)**
| ---
| *A system that computes and communicates using symbols.*

| **Program (/ˈproʊgræm, -grəm/)**
| ---
| *A set of coded instructions that make a computer perform an operation.*

#### Reflection exercise

Data mining is an essential part of AI. You almost can guess its meaning by the word "mining". If you understand the process of Coal mining or Oil mining, try to come up your OWN definition of Data mining and compare it to the textbook definition of data mining.
