# 3.2 Augmented Reality consultation during COVID-19 ![11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-11%2B-blueviolet)

Augmented reality and artificial intelligence are distinct technologies, but they can be used together to create unique experiences. In augmented reality, a 3D representation of the world must be constructed to allow digital objects to exist alongside physical ones. Visual data is used along with an accelerometer and gyroscopes to build a map of the world and track movement within it. Most of these tasks are still done using traditional computer vision techniques that make no use of machine learning.

Independently, however, AI models have gotten incredibly good at doing many of the things required to build immersive AR experiences. Deep neural networks can detect vertical and horizontal planes, estimate depth and segment images for realistic occlusion, and even infer 3D positions of objects in real-time. Because of these abilities, AI models are replacing some of the more traditional computer vision approaches underpinning AR experiences.

#### Story 9:  How AI-Powered Augmented Reality Helps during Pandemics ![11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-11%2B-blueviolet)

Do you know AR or VR? Have you experienced AR or VR? What do you think of these emerging technologies especially during this pandemic? AR and VR technologies are emerging as effective solutions in this time as they enable people to connect with others virtually. The pandemic has also brought opportunities for telemedicine or telehealth platforms that are able to offer both patients and care providers a different experience while delivering treatment. These technologies provide engagement for the users, patients and doctors. JD Health, a subsidiary of e-commerce giant JD.com, saw a tenfold growth in monthly consultations for its online health platform during the coronavirus epidemic. In addition, a provider of extended reality and therapeutic applications XRHealth is developing VR telehealth support in its response to prevent the spread of the virus. So, as businesses are suffering due to the spread of COVID-19, such immersive technologies are emerging as their rescue solutions helping them to keep sustain and improve their business profitability not only during the pandemic, but also post-crisis era. It is highly recommended that you try out these emerging technologies.

| *Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment that is similar or different from the real world. Unlike traditional user interfaces where users see environments on the screen, users will use Head-mounted display (VR glasses) to be within the VR environment and interact with its components.*
