# Chapter 6 Social Impact: How AI will impact your life? ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) may have good impact on societies, ecosystems, and human lives, including the human mind, in part because of the new ways in which it influences human thinking and decision-making, and affects education, science, culture, and communication and information. AI systems can be of great service to humanity, but also raises fundamental concerns. For instance, we can talk about artificial stupidity, racist robots, discrimination, job loss etc.  The following AI examples can be found that someone should know and consider while developing AI-based solutions.

- Inaccurate data while training AI systems can lead to inaccurate or unfair decisions for some people. For instance, the system may not detect that someone is infected with COVID-19 when he/she is infected. This can put his/her life and the life of others in danger.

- AI systems should consider the privacy of persons (patients) while treating them in order to keep their information safe and protect their private lives.

- The data generated by AI systems can be stored in different servers (e.g. hospital servers, institution servers, etc.), therefore someone may ask if this data belongs to the person (patient) since the system used his/her data, or to the developer/company because it developed the system or to the third party (hospitals, institutions, etc.) since they provided the servers for data collection and processing. Data ownership is a big issue in the field of AI that should be considered.

- Transparency of how AI systems work, including algorithms, data collection and processing is another issue that should be considered.

As shown in this book, AI adoption, especially in health care, is very useful, but still complex due to the social and ethical issues presented above. Whether AI is good or bad can be examined from several perspectives. Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind these issues while analyzing the broader societal issues at play. It is important need to keep learning and stay informed in order to make good decisions for our future.

Furthermore, it is clearly that AI and other emerging technologies, such as robotics, will take over several jobs in the future to make the work automated and faster (Internet of Business, n.d.). However, AI will also open up new opportunities for new jobs that did not exist before. These jobs will require new skills and new knowledge that were not needed long time ago, such as Python, React (web), Angular, machine learning, and Docker (Columbus, 2019). It is seen that several institutions and schools are now updating their curriculum to keep with AI technologies. Therefore, it is very important to keep learning about AI and its related technologies for a better future career.
