# 4.3 Hands-on learning experience: training the machine to perform an action ![13](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-13%2B-9cf)

Convolution Neural Network (CNNs) are largely applied in the domain of computer vision and have been highly successful in achieving state of the art performance on various test cases. The hidden layers in a CNN are generally convolution and pooling (downsampling) layers. In each convolution layer, we take a filter of a small size and move that filter across the image and perform convolution operations. Convolution operations are nothing but element-wise matrix multiplication between the filter values and the pixels in the image and the resultant values are summed.

| **CNN: Convolution (/ˌkɒnvəˈluʃən/) Neural (/ˈnʊərəl/) Network (/ ˈnɛtˌwɜrk/)**

| *CNN is a convolutional neural network is a feed-forward neural network that is generally used to analyze visual images by processing data with grid-like topology. It’s also known as a ConvNet. Generally, a convolutional neural network is used to detect and classify objects in an image.*

CNN is also computationally efficient. It uses special convolution and pooling operations and performs parameter sharing. This enables CNN models to run on any device, making them universally attractive. All in this sounds like pure magic. We are dealing with a very powerful and efficient model which performs automatic feature extraction to achieve superhuman accuracy. All CNN models follow a similar architecture, as shown in Figure 25.

Now, let’s move on to pooling layers. Pooling layers are used to downsize the image. The image would contain a lot of pixel values and it is typically easy for the network to learn the features if the image size is progressively reduced. Pooling layers help in reducing the number of parameters required and hence, this reduces the computation required. Pooling also helps in avoiding overfitting. There are two types of pooling operation that could be done:

- Max Pooling — Selecting the maximum value
- Average Pooling — Sum all of the values and dividing it by the total number of values

Before we start coding, I would like to let you know that the dataset we are going to use is the MNIST digits dataset and we are going to use the Keras library with a Tensorflow backend for building the model. Ok, enough. Let’s do some coding.

```python
import keras
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2Dimport numpy as np
```

First, let us do some necessary imports. The keras library helps us build our convolutional neural network. We download the mnist dataset through keras. We import a sequential model, which is a pre-built keras model where you can add the layers. We introduce the convolution and pooling layers. We also import dense layers as they are used to predict the labels. The dropout layer reduces overfitting and the flattening layer expands a three-dimensional vector into a one-dimensional vector. Finally, we import numpy for matrix operations.

```python
batch_size = 128
num_classes = 10
epochs = 12
# input image dimensions
img_rows, img_cols = 28, 28
# the data, split between train and test sets
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000,28,28,1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000,28,28,1)
print('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)
print(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')
print(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')
# convert class vectors to binary class matrices
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)
```

Most of the statements in the above code would be trivial, I would just explain some lines of the code. We reshape x_train and x_test because our CNN accepts only a four-dimensional vector. The value 60000 represents the number of images in the training data, 28 represents the image size and one represents the number of channels. The number of channels is set to one if the image is in grayscale and if the image is in RGB format, the number of channels is set to three. We also convert our target values into binary class matrices. To know what binary class matrices look like take a look at the example below.

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),  activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
```

We build a sequential model and add convolutional layers and max pooling layers to it. We also add dropout layers in between, dropout randomly switches off some neurons in the network which forces the data to find new paths. Therefore, this reduces overfitting. We add dense layers at the end which are used for class prediction(0–9).

```python
model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,              optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),  metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train,          batch_size=batch_size,          epochs=epochs,          verbose=1,          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])
```

We now compile the model with a categorical cross entropy loss function, Adadelta optimizer and an accuracy metric. We then fit the dataset to the model, i.e we train the model for 12 epochs. After training the model, we evaluate the loss and accuracy of the model on the test data and print it (see Figure 24).
