# 2.3 Hands-on learning experience: Face detection ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen)

This section will use a widely popular face detection and manipulation library face-recognition by Adam Geitgey. The images are customized with different colors and border shapes around the detected faces. First, import the useful libraries to our python code.

```python
import PIL.Image
import PIL.ImageDraw
import face_recognition
```

Please select the image name SchoolKids.jpg (you can pick up any image) in the same folder as the code file or else give the proper path of the image. The selected image would load by the **load_image_file()** method from the face_recognition library which will convert it into a NumPy array of that image. We can then assign it to the variable name given_image. Then assign it to the variable name given_image.

```python
given_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('SchoolKids.jpg')
```

Using **face_locations()** method from the same library, we will count the number of faces in the given_image and will print the length of total faces found in the image.

```python
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(given_image)
number_of_faces = len(face_locations)
print("We found {} face(s) in this image.".format(number_of_faces))
```

Accordingly, to draw any shape on the image, we will convert the image to the Pillow library object using **fromarray()** method from PIL.Image.

```python
pil_image = PIL.Image.fromarray(given_image)
```

Then, we will run a for-in loop to print four pixel locations such as top, left, bottom & right of the detected faces.

```python
for face_location in face_locations:
top, left, bottom, right = face_location
print("A face is detected at pixel location Top: {}, Left: {}, Bottom: {}, --Right:{}".format(top, left, bottom, right))
```

We will draw a green color rectangle box with width 10 around the faces.

```python
draw = PIL.ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)
draw.rectangle([left, top, right, bottom],outline="green", width=10)
```

Now, just use the variable pil_image to display our new image with detected faces using a rectangular border around them.

```python
pil_image.show()
```

The new temporary image will be open automatically on your computer (if everything is set up correctly). It should be something like Figure 13.

<br>
<center>
    <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);"
    src="https://md.hass.live/ai13.png">
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 1px;">Figure 13. Example of face detection within a given picture</div>
</center>
<br>

If you run the above file, and everything goes fine, you will get the below output at the console of your editor:

```
We found 5 face(s) in this image.
A face is detected at pixel location Top: 1454, Left: 3451, Bottom: 1775, Right: 3130
A face is detected at pixel location Top: 1784, Left: 1904, Bottom: 1939, Right: 1749
A face is detected at pixel location Top: 1818, Left: 2351, Bottom: 1973, Right: 2196
A face is detected at pixel location Top: 1830, Left: 1529, Bottom: 1959, Right: 1400
A face is detected at pixel location Top: 1878, Left: 2445, Bottom: 1967, Right: 2355
```
