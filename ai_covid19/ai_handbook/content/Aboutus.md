### Youth Artificial Intelligence Innovation Initiative (YAIII)

The development and application of intelligent technology represented by artificial intelligence has brought changes in education content, mode, and environment. In order to cope with the opportunities and challenges of education in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it is better to carry out AI education in primary and secondary schools, and cultivate innovative talents for the future.

In this context, Beijing Normal University (BNU) is actively advocating a lot of attention to the education of artificial intelligence and the growth of young people. In 2019, the National Engineering Laboratory for Cyber learning and Intelligent Technology (CIT) and Smart learning Institute of Beijing Normal University (SLI) have officially released the Youth Artificial Intelligence Innovation Initiative (YAIII).
