# ActionBook

> **ActionBook** is developed to facilitate digital textbooks using AI, AR, VR, IoT, etc. This interactive book is the first publication of ActionBook series on <http://actionbook.bnu.edu.cn>

This book introduces AI to children, between the age of 9 and 15, in an easy and fun way. It also presents vivid stories about some AI-based solutions that were developed to combat the pandemic. Furthermore, this book presents a hands-on learning experience about AI by showing simple programming code that children could use and implement on the JupyterLab environment.

Three age tags were used on the book content (`chapter`, `section` and `story`). Each tag denotes the age appropriateness of that content, as follow:

- ![9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-9%2B-brightgreen) tag highlights the sections that are appropriate for children of the age of nine and above.

- ![11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-11%2B-blueviolet) tag highlights the sections that are appropriate for children of the age of eleven and above.

- ![13](https://img.shields.io/badge/Age-13%2B-9cf) tag highlights the sections that are appropriate for children of the age of thirteen and above.

The age appropriateness for each of the book chapters, sections and stories was based on Coh-Metrix software and several AI teachers. Coh-Metrix is a computational tool that produces indices of the linguistic and discourse representations of a text (Graesser et al., 2004; McNamara et al., 2014). The produced output values can be used in many different ways to investigate the difficulty, readability and the coherence of the mental representation of the interactive book texts.

Additionally, a textbox definition was given to each “Bold” term in the text. This textbox aims to further explain that term for children. Furthermore, at the end of each section, an exercise was given in the form of a quiz or a reflection question, to help children practice the gained knowledge from that section.
  
It should be noted that this book can also be read by other people with different ages who may not have any background about AI. Parents and teachers can also use this book to introduce AI to their children or students respectively, and guide them to interact with the presented code online.

#### What is JupyterHub

JupyterHub is the best way to serve Jupyter notebook for multiple users. It can be used in a classes of students, a corporate data science group or scientific research group. It is a multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
